## Research

My research interests center around single-cell genomics, machine learning, and information retrieval.

## Projects

- 2019 - 2020, Resistant Fit Normalization for Single-cell RNA Sequencing Data.
- 2019 - 2020, Consensus Analysis to Identify Novel Gene Candidates in T Cell Differentiation.

## Reading

- While there is much great material on StackOverflow and Medium to pick up new skills, I still believe reading books is one of the best ways to be an expert.

- I am a [Tsundoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundoku) reader who tends to collect more books than I could ever finish.

- Here is a list of books, which I finished and would like to recommend to friends. (Coming Soon)

## Writing

I have a [Medium Blog](https://kuangda-derek.medium.com/) to take notes on my reflections and explorations.
